## Usage
```
$ docker run --rm znly/protoc --help
Usage: /usr/bin/protoc [OPTION] PROTO_FILES
```

Don't forget you need to bind mount your files:
```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) znly/protoc --python_out=. -I. myfile.proto
```

## Google Well Known Types
They are embedded in the image and are included by `protoc` automatically.
They accessible via `google/protobuf/`:
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";
import "google/protobuf/duration.proto";
```

## Gogo
`gogo.proto` is embedded in the image and can be included with:
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

import "github.com/gogo/protobuf/gogoproto/gogo.proto";
```

## Image Size
The current image is <200mb and one layer. Most the space is spent on Go tools.
All the binaries are UPX'ed. Including the Swift stdlib.
