  - github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
  - github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gofast
  - github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gogo
  - github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gogofast

## Usage
```
$ docker run --rm znly/protoc --help
Usage: /usr/bin/protoc [OPTION] PROTO_FILES
```

Don't forget you need to bind mount your files:
```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd) -w $(pwd) znly/protoc --python_out=. myfile.proto
```

## Google Well Known Types
They are embedded in the image and are included by `protoc` automatically.
They accessible via `google/protobuf/`:
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";
import "google/protobuf/duration.proto";
```

## Image Size
The current currently sits at ~290mb and one layer. Most the space is spent on Go tools.
